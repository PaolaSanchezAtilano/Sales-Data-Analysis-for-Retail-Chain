# Retail Sales Data Analysis with Python

## Project Description

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset from a multi-store beverage chain.

The main objective is to transform raw sales data stored in an Excel file into meaningful business insights that support data-driven decision-making.

This project was developed as part of a data analysis training process, focused on applying real-world techniques for data exploration and business visualization.
